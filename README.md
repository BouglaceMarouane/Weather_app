# Weather App GUI

Creating a weather app with Python and PyQt was a fun and rewarding experience. I learned how to connect to a weather API, fetch live data, and display it in a clean, interactive interface (GUI).It allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city by interacting with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.This project really helped me understand how to bring together backend logic and a visual interface. Sharing it on GitHub is a way to track my progress and keep improving my skills in Python and GUI development.
